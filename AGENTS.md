## Repository scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Contribution checklist
- Keep governance and determinism guarantees explicit in docs.
- Prefer small, auditable changes and reference concrete file paths.
- Run `npm run check` before committing when possible.

## Documentation conventions
- Update `README.md` when adding or changing major phases/workstreams.
- Represent roadmap items as markdown checklists (`- [x]` / `- [ ]`).
- Keep examples copy-pasteable and aligned with existing scripts.
